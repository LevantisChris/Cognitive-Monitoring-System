## üì± Overview

**LogMyself** is an advanced Android application designed to help users understand their daily behavioral patterns through comprehensive data tracking and analytics. The app monitors various aspects of user behavior including activity patterns, sleep cycles, device interactions, location movements, and more.

By providing detailed insights and visualizations, LogMyself empowers users to make data-driven decisions about their daily habits and lifestyle choices.

> **Note**: LogMyself integrates with **LogBoard**, a companion keyboard application, to provide typing analytics. Keyboard data is captured by LogBoard and analyzed on a secure backend server. LogMyself displays the analyzed typing insights without directly capturing keystrokes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Android Studio** (Jellyfish 2023.3.1 or later recommended)
- **JDK 11** or higher
- **Android SDK** with API level 31+
- **Git** for version control

### Required API Keys & Credentials

LogMyself requires several external services. You'll need to set up:

1. **Google Maps API Key** (for location features)
2. **Firebase Project** (for authentication and cloud storage)
3. **Supabase Project** (for database backend)

### Optional Companion App

- **LogBoard** (optional): A separate keyboard application for typing analytics. Install LogBoard if you want to use the typing insights feature. LogMyself works fully without it, but the Typing section will be empty.

### Quick Start

> ‚ö° **TL;DR**: For experienced developers who want to get started immediately:

```bash
# 1. Clone and open in Android Studio
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LogMyself.git
cd LogMyself

# 2. Create local.properties with your SDK path and Google Maps API key
echo "sdk.dir=/path/to/your/android/sdk" > local.properties
echo "MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_MAPS_API_KEY" >> local.properties

# 3. Create app/.env with Supabase credentials
cp app/env_template.txt app/.env
# Edit app/.env with your Supabase URL and key

# 4. Download google-services.json from Firebase Console
# Place it in app/ directory

# 5. Build and run
./gradlew installDebug
```

For detailed setup instructions, see below ‚¨áÔ∏è

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LogMyself.git
cd LogMyself
```

#### 2. Configure Local Properties

Create a `local.properties` file in the project root directory:

```properties
## This file is automatically generated by Android Studio.
# Do not modify this file -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE ERASED!
#
# Location of the SDK. This is only used by Gradle.
sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk

# Google Maps API Key
MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE
```

> üí° **Tip**: You can use `local.properties_example` as a template.

#### 3. Configure Supabase Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the `app/` directory:

```bash
# Copy the template and edit with your credentials
cp app/env_template.txt app/.env
```

Then edit `app/.env` with your actual credentials:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here
```

**To get your Supabase credentials:**
1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí API
3. Copy the Project URL and anon/public key

#### 4. Set Up Firebase

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Add an Android app to your Firebase project
   - Package name: `com.levantis.logmyself`
3. Download the `google-services.json` file
4. Place it in the `app/` directory (replacing `google-services.json.example`)

**Enable Firebase Services:**
- **Authentication**: Enable Google Sign-in provider
- **Firestore Database**: Create a database in production mode
- **Crashlytics**: Enable crash reporting

> üí° **Tip**: See `app/google-services.json.example` for reference structure

#### 5. Set Up Google Maps API

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Places API
4. Create credentials (API Key)
5. Restrict the API key to Android apps with your package name
6. Copy the API key to your `local.properties` file

#### 6. Sync and Build

1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
3. Build the project: `Build ‚Üí Make Project`
4. Run on an emulator or physical device

### Running the App

#### Using Android Studio
1. Connect an Android device (API 31+) or start an emulator
2. Click the "Run" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) or press `Shift + F10`
3. Select your target device
4. Wait for the app to install and launch

#### Using Command Line
```bash
# Debug build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on connected device
./gradlew installDebug

# Build and run
./gradlew installDebug && adb shell am start -n com.levantis.logmyself/.MainActivity
```

- No data is shared with third parties without consent

## üß™ Testing

### Running Unit Tests
```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Running Instrumented Tests
```bash
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## üîß Building for Release

### Create a Release Build

1. Generate a signing key:
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore logmyself-release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias logmyself
```

2. Create `keystore.properties` in the project root:
```properties
storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=logmyself
storeFile=../logmyself-release-key.jks
```

3. Build the release APK:
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The signed APK will be located at: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Building an App Bundle (AAB)
```bash
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

The AAB will be located at: `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is LogBoard and do I need it?**  
A: LogBoard is a companion keyboard application that provides typing analytics for LogMyself. It's optional - LogMyself works without it, but you won't have typing insights. LogBoard captures keyboard usage patterns and sends them to a secure backend server for analysis. LogMyself then displays these analyzed insights in the Typing section.

**Q: Does LogMyself capture my keystrokes?**  
A: No! LogMyself does NOT capture any keyboard data or keystrokes. All typing analytics come from the separate LogBoard application. If you don't install LogBoard, LogMyself will not have access to any typing data.

**Q: Does this app drain my battery?**  
A: LogMyself is designed to be battery-efficient. It uses a foreground service with optimized monitoring intervals and build-in APIs. However, continuous tracking does use some battery. You can monitor battery usage in your device settings.

**Q: What Android version do I need?**  
A: LogMyself requires Android 12 (API level 31) or higher.

**Q: Why does the app need so many permissions?**  
A: Each permission serves a specific monitoring purpose:
- Location: Track where you spend your time
- Activity Recognition: Detect walking, running, driving
- Call Log: Monitor communication patterns
- Notifications: Understand app usage
All permissions are optional for basic functionality, but some features require specific permissions.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Where is my data stored?**  
A: Data is stored in multiple places depending on the type:
1. **Firebase Firestore**: Cloud for your LogMyself data
2. **Supabase**: Additional backend analytics
3. **LogBoard Backend**: Typing data is stored and analyzed on LogBoard's secure backend server (separate from LogMyself)

**Q: The background service keeps stopping. What should I do?**  
A: 
1. Disable battery optimization for LogMyself in Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí LogMyself ‚Üí Battery
2. Ensure the app has "Allow all the time" location permission
3. Check that the app is not restricted in background

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures

**Issue**: Gradle sync fails with dependency errors  
**Solution**: 
```bash
./gradlew clean
./gradlew --refresh-dependencies
```

**Issue**: Google services plugin error  
**Solution**: Ensure `google-services.json` is in the `app/` directory

#### Runtime Issues

**Issue**: App crashes on launch  
**Solution**: Check Firebase Authentication is properly configured and Google Sign-in is enabled

**Issue**: Location tracking not working  
**Solution**: Verify location permissions are granted and Google Maps API key is valid

**Issue**: Background service stops  
**Solution**: Disable battery optimization for LogMyself in device settings

#### Permission Issues

**Issue**: Permissions dialog not appearing  
**Solution**: Manually grant permissions in Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí LogMyself ‚Üí Permissions

### Debugging
